### Initial Release Goals
- Functional settlements
	- Resource production
	- Buildable facilities
	- Drawn territories
- Simple faction management
	- Settlement construction
	- Resource deliveries
- Customization
	- Custom emblems for player, procedural for faction
- AI		
	- Basic expansion
	- Basic resource management

### Eventual Goals
- Better UI
	- Better selection menus for facilities
	- "Give resources" button in overview stockpile tax
- Diplomacy
	- Conflicts
	- Faction Relations
- Customization
	- Faction civics/ethics
	- Custom emblems & UI
	- Tax window (maybe button in overview): Tax rate (by ResourceDef) and delivery. Also, customize what is delivered (also by resource def; like tithe, but with trade menu). See Tradeable.cs
- Events
- Military
	- Callable soldiers (see Discord message)
	- Each faction has a global military budget pool. Combat losses (wealth or pawns) are deducted from this pool.
	- The soldiers are stationed in settlements, which is where they're deployed. Pawn losses also impact settlement happiness/loyalty.
- Extensibility
	- Move hardcoded values/objects to defs?
- Better DLC Compatibility
	- Customizable Ideologies
	- Customizable Xenotypes
- Prevent AI from building settlements on tiles that already have one in progress (in the future; right now, it gets placed immediately)
